I writed this script for your security.
All you need - it's put file for encryption
in the same folder where script located and
just a launch CryptHelper.




INSTRUCTION		

1. You need to clone this repository using this command:
		
		git clone https://github.com/FWorld21/CryptoHelper.git

2. Go to the directory and give exec permission for script:
		
		cd CryptoHelper && chmod +x cryptohelper.py

3. That's all! Now you can launch my script:
		
		./cryptohelper.py
   
3.1. Or:
    python cryptohelper.py




THANK YOU
